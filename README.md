2. Click the **Monkeybot** button to open the chat window.
3. Type a question and either press **Enter** or click the send button.
4. The bot will respond with a randomly generated string.

## Project Structure

- `indexMonkey.html` – main page containing the chat UI.
- `chatbot.css` – styling for the chat window and page backgrounds.
- `monkeyScript.js` – JavaScript powering the chatbot interaction.
